## LING 576: CORPUS LINGUISTICS
Source code repository for corpus linguistics taught at Portland State University.

### Labs (work-in-progress)
The labs for this course are designed for non-programmers.  One of my goals was to create programming
versions of the assignments, so that students interested in NLP could do this option.  I have Lab 1 
completed.  _Stay tuned!_
